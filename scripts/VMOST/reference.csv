110103,"Okay. What would you say that the overall, ideal, end-state towards which the library strives is?","I think of it as sort of like an, um, oh, ah, it is sort of an information clearing house. We want to sort of be all things to all people; students, public, faculty. But it's also a place, so a place where people come to do all those things. It's not just where you acquire all the things but where, ya know, you come to actually find out the information. What, even if the information is not in house."
111025,"What would you say that the overall, ideal, end-state towards which the organization strives? In other words what's the library's vision? Some of this may seem familiar…","That's okay. I, I think what I understand is the library's vision is to create an environment that's accessible and inclusive and, ah, that encourages people not only to, ah, learn, ah, at their own pace and on their own, in their own way but also to, ah, reach out for help and to provide assistance and teaching for true people that need it and in the case advising to some classes on whether they don't think they need it or not cause it's mandatory. But, I, I think it's, ah, it's definitely along those lines of an open inclusive environment. Diversity ...."
111027,"Um, okay, question number 1. What is the overall, ideal, end-state towards which the organization, in this case the library, strives? To put it another way, what's the vision of the library?","Oh, um, my understanding is that the vision of the library is to provide access to information to support the research and teaching needs of the campus community. Sure, okay, um, I, I don't know that I can really elaborate on that primarily, um, except that, um, ya know, our, our role here in the, um, in special collections is to, um, do all, ya know, provide access to information for teaching and research but also to preserve, ya know, rare and unique materials. Um, and I think that a really big part of that vision is, um, has to do with accessibility to resources, to, um, ya know, the reference librarians to the physical library itself, um, and just making sure that we are, ya know, a very bustling hub of activity as far as that's concerned, um, just in relation to, ya know, providing a place for students to study and, um, ya know, making resources and space available and stuff like that."
111103,"Mm hm. Yup. That, that is the goal. Okay, um, and then please feel free to ask me to repeat myself and please shout a little bit for the benefit for the tape recorder and the poor soul I'm gonna get to transcribe this all later. Um, okay. Question number 1… what is the overall, ideal, end-state towards which the organization, in this case the library, strives? Or to put it another way, what's the library's vision? And I know you guys just did the strategic study.","Yeah. Well I think it is to, um, provide effective and efficient service for our users, um, in a friendly manner. I think that we also strive to be on the cutting edge as far as using technology to deliver those services."
120120,"Um, okay, so question number 1. Um, what is the overall, ideal, end-state towards which the library as an organization strives? Or the short version, what would you say that the library's vision is?","To provide information to students. In terms of research access or research access, either one. Access to information?"
120203,"Alright, um, what would you say that the overall, ideal, end-state towards which the library strives is? Or to put it another way, what would you say that the vision of the library is?","I think it's to be an integral part of the, of Towson University, um, the whole culture and identity. Um, it means to (inaudible), evolve, and change as, as that institute evolves and changes and because change is the only constant from now on."
120210,"What would you say that the overall, ideal, end-state towards which the library strives is? Or to put it another way, what would you say that the library's vision is?","I would say that our vision or ultimate goal is to support the study that goes on here at Towson and to help develop information literacy, um, among students, staff, and faculty."
120801,"Um, what would you say that the overall, ideal, end-state towards which the organization, aka the library, strives for? To put it another way, what's the library's vision?","Our vision is to be, ah, a, hmm, let me think here… We actually have a formal vision statement, which I have not memorized. In general our vision is to be, um, high qual... To be and to provide high quality support to our students, our faculty, our staff. In other words the, the overall Towson University community. To provide high quality support services, resources, um, to further the academic and scholarly endeavors of our community."
110104,"What would you say that the overall, ideal, end-state towards which the library strives is? What's the library's vision?","Our vision is to ultimately… Um, for students, we have, it's a parallel vision. For students the ultimate vision is to, um, be sure that they are information independent in a sense that they are able to find the information that they need to make critical judgements about what they do find and then to be able to use the information for the purpose of solving an intellectual career or personal problem. So that's, that's, that's our end-game. That's what we really want to do. I'm sorry, and then for the faculty we want to, um, help them be successful at the teaching and research and publication."
101217,"Um, okay, so question number 1. What would you say that the overall, ideal, end-state toward which the library strives is? What's the library's vision?","Oh my gosh, well, we are strategic planning now. We've gotten that written down somewhere but things that are in the mission and the vision include access to materials, making them available, making them discoverable, findable, making them things that can be easily delivered, and most of these things are, ah ya know, information that people want for lifelong learning, information that people want for specific research interests, ah, and also to facilitate communications in the forms of scholarly communication or publishing or, ya know, whatever, so we're supporting academic enterprise as a place to find and access information, process it, and analyze it, and presumably produce it in some cases. Concise isn't it?"
101215,"And do the best you can.  Okay, what would you describe as the overall ideal end state towards which the library, as an institution, strives?","The overall state? Oh, I think as being a research center for both students and faculty. The place where they turn for their research needs. The portal, for lack of a better term. I think that we really worked hard to get a mission statement that was over-arching. It didn’t make us appear to be information geeks.  We acknowledge that we want to be a gathering place for students. But also, that we serve as the portal.  The place where they can go to get information, they can go to ask about information, and they can go to be trained in how to find information and evaluate it."
