717499,Medium,,Provide the ability to inquire on condition assessment history for every asset.
717500,Medium,,"Allow user to display/report current condition assessment data for one or more asset types or maintenance features by actual  score or converted letter grade. The user must be able to select the condition assessment for each asset based on various  parameters such as sample identifier, most recent assessment, and average of all assessments over a date range. The user  must also be able to select by highway system (All, Interstate, NHS, etc.) and location parameters including route, mile point to  mile point, Statewide, district, county, or maintenance shop and indicate whether to report the functional condition, physical  condition or both."
717501,Medium,,"Allow user to display/report current condition assessment data for one or more asset classes by converted letter grade. This  grade must be based on the weighted average established for the asset types and maintenance features within that asset class  or classes. The user must be able to select the condition assessment for each asset based on various parameters such as  sample identifier, most recent assessment, and average of all assessments over a date range. The user must also be able to  select by highway system (All, Interstate, NHS, etc.) and location parameters including route, mile point to mile point, Statewide,  district, county, or maintenance shop and indicate whether to report the functional condition, the physical condition or both."
717502,Medium,,"Generate management scorecard showing actual functional condition for each asset type or maintenance feature as either the  actual score or a converted letter grade and the target level of service for that asset type or maintenance feature. Scorecard  must be able to be created by highway system (All, interstate, NHS, etc.) and at the Statewide, district, county or maintenance  shop level. The user must be able to select the data to be included on the scorecard based on various parameters such as  sample identified, most recent assessment and rolling average of all assessments over a date range."
717503,Medium,,"Generate management scorecard showing functional condition for each asset class as a weighted, converted letter grade. This  grade must be based on the weighted average established for the asset types and maintenance features within that asset class  or classes. Scorecard must be able to be created at the Statewide, district, county or maintenance shop level or for a class of  highway (Interstate, NHS, etc.).

717504,Medium,,"Create in graphical format a year over year historical analysis or trend line of condition ratings for an asset type or maintenance  feature for the functional condition. The user must be able to select the asset type, whether to use the actual score or the  converted letter grade, the location (Statewide, district, county or maintenance shop) and/or highway system (All, Interstate,  NHS, etc.) being compared, the range of years for comparison and whether the comparison is for fiscal year or calendar year."
