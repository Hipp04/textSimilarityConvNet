"Section:PL-Facilities Management, LOS Rating Scales (5 Reqs)"
713466,Medium,,"Provide capability to define a unique level of service or condition rating scale for each system, component or maintenance  feature. The condition rating scale must define the type (numeric, alpha), range of acceptable values and the high and low end of  the range. As an example, one asset type could have a numeric condition rating ranging from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest), while  another asset type could have an alphabetic rating scheme from F (lowest) to A (highest)."
713467,Medium,,"Provide for each system, component or maintenance feature condition rating scale the ability to establish thresholds for letter  grades for numeric scales for purposes of creating management scorecards."
713468,Medium,,"Provide the capability for a user to record a target level of service/target condition rating for a facility class (lodges, travel plazas,  internal office space, customer facing office space, etc.), at an agency-wide level and/or at other user-defined organizational  groupings within an agency (district, region, facility group/campus, etc.). The target level of service must be in the form of a letter  grade with valid values ranging from A to F, allowing for +/- grades within that scale."
713469,Medium,,"Provide the capability for a user to record a target level of service/target condition rating for a system, component or  maintenance feature at both the agency-wide level and/or at other user-defined organizational groupings (region, district, park,  etc.). Target level of service must be in the form of a letter grade with valid values ranging from A to F, allowing for +/- grades  within that scale."
713470,Medium,,"Provide for each facility class the ability for an authorized user to define the weighting to be given to the converted or letter grade  score for each sub-facility, system, component or maintenance feature within the facility class when generating a condition  assessment rating for the entire asset class. As an example, the class rating for a park lodge might have a number of separate  system or maintenance feature ratings such as: parking lot pavement condition, parking lot cleanliness, sidewalks, outside  grounds, public area walls and floors, restroom cleanliness, etc. An authorized user would be able to place a weighting value on  each of these categories of > 0 and < 1.0 such that the total weighting for all of the systems/features in the facility equals 1.0.  The user must also enter an effective date for this weighting. The weighting will then be used to calculate the facility class  condition rating or score in any reports or management scorecards or trend analysis as of the effective date entered."
