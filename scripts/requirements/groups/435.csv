717564,Medium,,"Provide capability to develop proposed budget by modeling the impact of achieving different target levels of service for asset  types and maintenance features based on the user defined letter grade scale for that asset or maintenance feature and the  associated level of effort (LOE) factors; for example if the current condition assessment for an asset is a ""B"" and the statewide  target level of service is an ""A"", the user must be able to model the budget impact of moving from a ""B"" level of service to a ""B+""  or ""A-"" or ""A"" level of service."
717565,Medium,,"Provide capability to specify a target LOS and allow system to calculate the required level of effort (LOE) (e.g., tons of asphalt  patching per lane-mile, linear feet of crack sealing per lane-mile, labor-hours of repair per impact attenuator, etc.) This is  accomplished by converting the difference between actual and target LOS into a incremental additional work effort per unit of  inventory. By multiplying the LOE by the feature inventory, an additional annual work quantity is obtained for that feature, which is  added to the previous annual work quantity to obtain the annual work quantity for the new budget year."
717566,Medium,,"Retain ""what if"" scenarios for a user defined period of time."

717577,Medium,,"Integrate with the ERP cost accounting, fleet, inventory, personnel administration and time and labor functions to obtain required  labor, equipment and materials cost factors for budgeting purposes."
717578,Medium,,"Maintain standard resource cost factors for labor, equipment and materials."
717579,Medium,,Store code number for resource.
717580,Medium,,Store description of resource.
717581,Medium,,Store unit cost of resource.

717583,Medium,,"Store overtime rates for multiple categories of overtime or comp time such as normal, holiday, on-call, etc. for a resource."
717584,Medium,,Store overhead factors for resource.
717585,Medium,,Store a valid date range for all associated cost/rate data for a resource.
717586,Medium,,Allow for adjustment of standard resource cost factors at the district level.
717587,Medium,,Allow for the application of a user defined overtime factor (multiplier).
717588,Medium,,"Maintain the standard resource cost factors for all previous, current, and next budget years."
717589,Medium,,Support the ability to derive next year's standard resource cost factors for budgeting purposes by copying the current year unit  cost data to the next budget year.
717590,Medium,,"Support the ability to derive next year's standard resource cost factors for budgeting purposes by copying the current year unit  cost data to the next budget year, with a user-defined multiplier applied for each type of resource."
717591,Medium,,Support the ability to derive next year's standard resource cost factors for budgeting purposes by allowing for manual override of  unit cost data for the next budget year.
717592,Medium,,"Calculate an activity-based annual work plan, (i.e., the annual number of crew-days required to accomplish the annual work  quantity in the budget) This calculation divides the annual work quantity by the appropriate average daily work accomplishment  from the activity performance guidelines to determine the required annual number of crew-days of work for each maintenance  feature in the district or maintenance unit."
717593,Medium,,Support budgeting by using contracts as a resource in addition to in-house resources using a contract unit cost for the activity.
717594,Medium,,Allow for the tracking of historical contract data for planning purposes.
