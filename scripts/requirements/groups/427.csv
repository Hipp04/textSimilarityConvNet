"Section:PL-Transportation Asset Inventory, LOS Rating Scales (5 Reqs)"
717478,Medium,,"Provide capability to define a unique condition rating scale for each asset type or maintenance feature. The condition rating scale  must define the type (numeric, alpha), range of acceptable values and the high and low end of the range. As an example, one  asset type could have a numeric condition rating ranging from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest), while another asset type could have an  alphabetic rating scheme from F (lowest) to A (highest). This scale must be able to be established for each asset type for both  the functional condition (performance of the asset in terms of its intended purpose) and the physical condition of the asset."
717479,Medium,,Provide for each asset type or maintenance feature condition rating scale the ability to establish thresholds for letter grades for  numeric scales for purposes of creating management scorecards.
717480,Medium,,"Provide the capability for a user to record a target level of service/target condition rating for an asset class at both the statewide  and district levels. The target level of service must be in the form of a letter grade with valid values ranging from A to F, allowing  for +/- grades within that scale."
717481,Medium,,"Provide the capability for a user to record a target level of service/target condition rating for an asset type or maintenance feature  at both the statewide and district levels. Target level of service must be in the form of a letter grade with valid values ranging  from A to F, allowing for +/- grades within that scale."
717482,Medium,,"Provide for each asset class the ability for an authorized user to define the weighting to be given to the converted or letter grade  score for each asset type or maintenance feature within the asset class when generating a condition assessment rating for the  entire asset class. As an example, the Pavement asset class might have five asset types: curb and gutter; rigid pavements;  flexible pavements; paved musters and unpaved musters. An authorized user would be able to place a weighting value on each  of these five categories of > 0 and < 1.0 such that the total weighting for all of the asset types in the asset class equals 1.0. The  user must also enter an effective date for this weighting. The weighting will then be used to calculate the asset class condition  rating or score in any reports or management scorecards or trend analysis as of the effective date entered by the user."
