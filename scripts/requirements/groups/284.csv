"Section:PL-Pavement Management, Optimization (26 Reqs)"
714869,High,,"Provide an optimization process that manages the analysis at various levels including statewide, highway system, Federal Aid,  APB, functional classification, pavement type, ADT/EASL, district, county, route and project."
714870,High,,Recommend a treatment strategy (or treatment cost category) to the candidate section based on a selected optimization method.
714871,High,,"Perform ""what if"" analysis of different funding scenarios and project priorities to optimize projects for various groupings including  statewide, a specific highway system, a specific funding source (Federal Aid, APB, State only, etc.) or specific district."
714872,High,,Predict future pavement performance given a specific budget.
714873,High,,"Establish project priority lists that optimize funding scenarios for one-year, five-year and ten-year plans based on user defined  objective functions for statewide, a highway system, a specific funding source or a specific district."
714874,High,,Allow an authorized user to override the system's treatment recommendation and assign a different treatment.
714875,High,,"Store results of multiple scenarios and compare recommended treatments, budgets, funding sources and performance results  across scenarios."
714876,High,,"Prioritize candidate projects based upon user defined criteria which can vary by highway system, districts, ADT/ESL, mix design  or other factors. User defined criteria should include at a minimum: remaining service life (RSL) of the pavement; existing  pavement condition; cost; life cycle cost; truck annual average daily traffic (TADDT); equivalent single axle load (ESAL); and user  override."
714877,High,,Provide the capability to prioritize /optimize candidate projects based on funding levels.
714878,High,,Calculate historical project costs for definable segments of highway.
714879,High,,Calculate future project costs for definable segments of highway.
714880,Low,,Allow for incorporation of user costs into the optimization process.
714881,Low,,"Support calculation of user cost including consideration of incremental cost of crashes which may occur, excess travel time, and  motor vehicle operating costs among other factors."
714882,Medium,,"Incorporate user-specified inflation rates that can vary by year in treatment cost estimates for labor, equipment and materials."
714883,Medium,,Support utilizing multiple sets of cost data to be stored by treatment type and district and applied in a given scenario run.
714884,Medium,,Utilize historical costs and user-defined engineering factors in calculation of the cost of various alternatives.
714885,Medium,,Maintain a history of cost estimates for candidate projects.
714886,Medium,,"Log reasons for changes to cost estimates for candidate projects over time (inflation, scope change, introduction of new  technology, enhanced estimating models, etc.)."
714887,Medium,,Support the ability to download information to an Excel-based or third party cost estimating model.
714888,Medium,,Support the ability to upload and store cost estimate information from an Excel-based or third party cost estimating model.
714889,High,,Allow the system administrator or other authorized user to revise parameters and formulas for running the analytical models  through a table-driven online function.
714890,High,,Allow input and update of budget constraints for each budget period over the planning horizon.
714891,Low,,Integrate with Primavera and the ERP projects and budget functions to obtain budget information.
714892,Medium,,"Support the use of other constraints in modeling such as federal funding limitations, matching ratios, level-of-service criteria, or  minimum allocations of funds to each district."
714893,High,,Incorporate updated project level treatment strategy and cost information into the proposed network level list of  planned/programmed projects under the scenario being modeled.
714894,Medium,,Integrate with Primavera and the ERP projects module to provide information about potential candidate projects based on user  initiated request in Primavera.
